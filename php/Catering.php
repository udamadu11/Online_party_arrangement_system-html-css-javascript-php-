		<p>
		We have one simple goal – your total immersion in the dream day you’ve imagined for so many years.

Your guests will be pampered as they join you in the celebration of your love. We are uncompromising on this point. For us a successful wedding is one where the bride and groom are caught up in the magic of the moment along with their guests.<br/><br/>While we have an extensive menu, much of which is available online, we often create menus specifically for a client. We take into consideration dietary sensitivities, preferences and event specific needs. Our staff can handle events of all sizes and scale.

<br/><br/>We are strong advocates of organic and sustainable food practices. We guarantee only the finest and freshest ingredients are used at Taste. Once your special menu is selected, our award-winning chefs go to work orchestrating every detail with your vision in mind. It might involve selecting locally grown seasonal produce or baking aromatic breads and delicate pastries. The result is a culinary experience to delight all of the senses, one that you and your guests will remember forever.

Creating the right catering menu with Taste is a mouth watering experience. Please view our selection of Dinner and Cocktail Reception Menus and the Food Gallery for ideas and then contact one of our experienced event designers to create a custom gourmet menu for your event.
