Portraits sessions will be by design with the collaboration of subjects. Our desire to create portraits that reflect who you are and your life style. Portraits sessions must include a pre-session consultation so that we can talk about the style of the portrait, clothing selections, and timing. 

Sessions are available for in studio, environmental, business, or in home sessions. For environmental portraits times are limited due to seasonal changes and lighting restrictions. Please make certain you schedule you session so that there is ample daylight available. Unless special portraits are to be taken, sessions are available from 10:00 a.m. until 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday. Some Sunday sessions can be arranged as requested 

Ambrosia Event Services offers plans that provide flexibility and a variety of options. We call this “Pick and Match” Options. By selecting a plan you may find that there are sizes and quantities that don’t fit what you are looking for. You have the “option” to pick from another plan what best fits your needs, or you may select to pick from our “a-la-carte” section.
